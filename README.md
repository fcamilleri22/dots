# COMING SOON!
### Don't try to use this yet, you will have a bad time.
### I'll update this README once this is actually usable, with **instructions.**

# The hell is this though?
### This is a collection of scripts and config files (dot files, thus "dots") with the intent of getting a fully customized and configured development environment for Frank Camilleri's work, which includes development for Node/JS/HTML/CSS, AWS, Terraform, Scala/Kotlin, LaTeX/md, and shell scripting.

### When this is finished, you should be able to, after installing the [Manjaro i3 Community Edition](https://manjaro.org/community-editions/), run a single command, restart X, and have a fully ready (and **STYLISH!**) development environment good to go.
